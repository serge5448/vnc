VNC Free Edition Source Distribution for Windows platforms
=============================================

VNC Free Edition is Copyright RealVNC Ltd. 2002-2008.  This software is
distributed under the GNU General Public Licence as published by the
Free Software Foundation.  See the accompanying licence.txt file for
the conditions under which the software is made available.

VNC Free Edition also contains code from other sources.  See the
Acknowledgements section below, and the individual files for details of
the conditions under which they are made available.

The source tree contains a number of directories, and is most easily
built by loading the VNC workspace file (vnc.dsw) into Microsoft
Visual Studio 6/7.  This will preserve the required dependencies
between the sub-projects.

There are three main executable projects:

	vncclient - The VNC Client for Win32.

	vncserver - The VNC Server for Win32 (command-line operation
		 only).

	vncconfig - The configuration applet and GUI front-end for VNC
		    Server.

These projects are designed to be built using Microsoft Visual C++
6.0, and should also compile with Microsoft Visual Studio .NET
(version 7).  Other compilers have not been tested but the code base
is extremely portable.
